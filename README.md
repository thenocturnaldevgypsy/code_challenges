## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-About%20this%20Repository-24292e?logo=repo&logoColor=white&labelColor=00416a)

In order to provide a steady stream of coding challenges that can help sharpen my skills in programming, I signed up to some coding challenges portals and created this repo to save my progress/activities.

## ![SECTION Contents and Breakdown](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-Contents%20and%20Breakdown-24292e?logo=book&logoColor=white&labelColor=00416a)
At the moment, I'm taking the following programming challenges tracks:
| Portal | PL | Directory in this Repo | Track |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Exercism.org | PHP | `Exercism.org - PHP` | 10 of 114 |
| Exercism.org | Python | `Exercism.org - Python` | 1 of 140 |

> [!NOTE]
> When I'm about to start with a challenge, I will always create an issue ticket with the programming challenge link info to keep track of my progress here at GitHub.

For those who are curious, you can view my profile and progress here:
